CTOR GAME — AI vs AI Edition
A compact, stable platform for developing and testing AI bots

The CTOR GAME AI vs AI Edition is a lightweight, browser‑based environment where two AI agents compete on an 8×8 CTOR board.
This version is intentionally implemented as a single self‑contained HTML file, making it easy to use, share, and extend.

It is ideal for:

🧑‍🎓 Students learning AI decision‑making

🧪 Researchers experimenting with strategies

🧠 Developers building custom CTOR bots

🎯 Anyone who wants a reproducible testing environment

🚀 Platform Features
✔️ Full CTOR GAME engine

✔️ Visual 8×8 board

✔️ Step‑by‑step execution

✔️ Automatic play mode

✔️ Built‑in bots

✔️ Uploading custom bots (.js)

✔️ Move validation & win detection

✔️ Simple API for writing bots

Everything runs directly in the browser — no installation required.

🧠 How CTOR Bots Work
A bot is a JavaScript function that receives:

the current board

the bot’s color ("R" or "B")

the move history

optional helper functions

It must return a move:

js
{ row: Number, col: Number }
🟦 Minimal bot example
js
export function myBot(board, color) {
  return { row: 0, col: 0 };
}
🛠 How to Write Your Own Bot
1️⃣ Create a file named myBot.js
js
export function myBot(board, color) {
  // Find the first empty cell
  for (let r = 0; r < 8; r++) {
    for (let c = 0; c < 8; c++) {
      if (board[r][c] === ".") {
        return { row: r, col: c };
      }
    }
  }
  return null; // no moves available
}
2️⃣ Ensure the function is exported
The platform expects:

Code
export function myBot(...)
3️⃣ Save the file as myBot.js
🧪 How to Test Your Bot
Open the CTOR GAME AI vs AI page (GitHub Pages).

Scroll to Upload Custom Bot.

Click Choose File → select your myBot.js.

Your bot appears in Available Bots.

Select it as Bot R or Bot B.

Press Start Match.

Use the controls:

Button	Function
▶️ Start Match	Start a new game
⏭ Next Move	Step-by-step execution
🔁 Auto Play	Continuous play
⏹ Stop	Pause the match
📘 Bot API Specification
Your bot receives:

Parameter	Type	Description
board	string[8][8]	8×8 matrix containing "R", "B", or "."
color	"R" or "B"	Your bot’s color
history	Array	List of previous moves
helpers	Object	Optional helper functions
Your bot must return:

js
{ row: Number, col: Number }
If the bot returns an illegal move → it loses automatically.

🧩 Example: A Greedy Bot
js
export function greedyBot(board, color) {
  let best = null;
  let bestScore = -1;

  for (let r = 0; r < 8; r++) {
    for (let c = 0; c < 8; c++) {
      if (board[r][c] !== ".") continue;

      const score = evaluateMove(board, r, c, color);
      if (score > bestScore) {
        bestScore = score;
        best = { row: r, col: c };
      }
    }
  }

  return best || null;
}
📂 Project Structure (Base Version)
Code
index.html   ← complete engine, UI, and logic in one file
README.md    ← this document
This version is intentionally monolithic for simplicity and reliability.

🎓 Guidelines for Students
Start with a simple bot

Add strategy gradually

Test against built‑in bots

Analyze losing positions

Try different heuristics

Experiment freely — the platform is deterministic
