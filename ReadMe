README — CTOR GAME: AI vs AI Edition
A minimal, stable platform for developing and testing AI bots

The CTOR GAME AI vs AI Edition is a compact, fully functional platform where two artificial intelligence agents compete on the CTOR board.
This version is intentionally implemented as a single self‑contained HTML file, making it easy to use, share, and extend without dealing with module loaders or complex project structures.

It is designed for:

students learning AI decision‑making,

researchers experimenting with strategies,

developers building custom CTOR bots,

anyone who wants a clean, reproducible environment for testing algorithms.

🎮 Platform Features
Complete CTOR GAME engine

Visual 8×8 board

Step‑by‑step execution

Automatic play mode

Built‑in bots

Uploading custom bots (.js files)

Move validation and win detection

Simple and stable API for writing bots

Everything runs directly in the browser.

🧠 How a CTOR Bot Works
A bot is simply a JavaScript function that receives:

the current board state,

the bot’s color ("R" or "B"),

the move history,

optional helper functions.

It must return a move:

js
{ row: Number, col: Number }
A minimal bot looks like this:

js
function myBot(board, color) {
  return { row: 0, col: 0 };
}
🛠 How to Write Your Own Bot
1. Create a file named myBot.js
Example:

js
export function myBot(board, color) {
  // Find the first empty cell
  for (let r = 0; r < 8; r++) {
    for (let c = 0; c < 8; c++) {
      if (board[r][c] === ".") {
        return { row: r, col: c };
      }
    }
  }
  return null; // no moves available
}
2. Make sure the function is exported
The platform expects:

Code
export function myBot(...)
3. Save the file as myBot.js
🧪 How to Test Your Bot on the Platform
Open the CTOR GAME AI vs AI page (GitHub Pages).

Scroll to Upload Custom Bot.

Click Choose File and select your myBot.js.

Your bot will appear in the Available Bots list.

Select it as Bot R or Bot B.

Press Start Match.

Use:

Next Move — step-by-step mode

Auto Play — continuous mode

Stop — pause the match

📂 Project Structure (Base Version)
Code
index.html   ← complete engine, UI, and logic in one file
README.md    ← this document
This version is intentionally monolithic for simplicity and reliability.

📘 Bot API Specification
Your bot receives:

Parameter	Description
board	8×8 matrix containing "R", "B", or "."
color	"R" or "B"
history	list of previous moves
helpers	optional helper functions
Your bot must return:

js
{ row: Number, col: Number }
If the bot returns an illegal move, it automatically loses.

🧩 Example of a More Advanced Bot
js
export function greedyBot(board, color) {
  let best = null;
  let bestScore = -1;

  for (let r = 0; r < 8; r++) {
    for (let c = 0; c < 8; c++) {
      if (board[r][c] !== ".") continue;

      const score = evaluateMove(board, r, c, color);
      if (score > bestScore) {
        bestScore = score;
        best = { row: r, col: c };
      }
    }
  }

  return best || null;
}
🎓 Guidelines for Students
Start with a simple bot.

Add strategy gradually.

Test against built‑in bots.

Analyze losing positions.

Try different heuristics.

Experiment freely — the platform is safe and deterministic
